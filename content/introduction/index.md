## Core Principles
- Value the individual
- But recognise we our succeed as a group
- Value open over closed minds

## Why?
After working in software for over a decade I finally realised why DevOps is so useful. This site is an attempt to put into words my understanding of how we should build software. This gathers together content from many sources listed in the reference section and take inspiration from (https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)[https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/] for the format.

## Cavets
As much as possible I have tried to keep personal basis out of the book and relied on data to inform decision. I do not see software development as a kind of artistic expression but rather as an engineering challenge. This leads to my view that guide much of this book.

This covers far more than the work of the software engineer. I focus on how to get from an idea to a running product and focus on the responsbility of each actor in that journey.

## FAQ
### Is this DevOps?
I find this to be a very difficult question to answer without knowing my audiance. As of 2018 I see DevOps and software engineering as the wild west. We have some very experienced people with very closed minds. This is a problem as I see the need for both open mindedness and high conteniousness to build an amazing software product.
